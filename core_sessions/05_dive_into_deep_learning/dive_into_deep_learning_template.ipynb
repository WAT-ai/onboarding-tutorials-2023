    "## Dive into Deep Learning\n",
    "Prerequisites:\n",
    "- Python experience, including a basing understanding of python syntax, loops, conditional statements, functions, and data types in python\n",
    "- Some background in numerical computing - MATLAB, R, numpy, or similar, and an understanding of vectors, matrices, and relevant linear algebra concepts\n",
    "- An understanding of model selection, train/test split, performance metrics and other concepts covered in the session on Classical Machine Learning\n",
    "- Concepts covered in Neural Networks for Novices are assumed to be prerequisite knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals for this session:\n",
    "- Discuss regularization strategies such as batch norm, layer norm, and dropout layers\n",
    "- Explore more complex model architectures, block structures, and applications of neural networks that are common in industry and academia\n",
    "- Investigate how deep learning can be applied to different data modalities and for a wider variety of machine learning tasks\n",
    "- Apply this knowledge to implement a deep learning model in PyTorch, based on technical specifications"
