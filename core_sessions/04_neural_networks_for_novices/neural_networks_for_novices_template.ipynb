    "## Neural Networks for Novices\n",
    "Prerequisites:\n",
    "- Python experience, including a basing understanding of python syntax, loops, conditional statements, functions, and data types in python\n",
    "- Some background in numerical computing - MATLAB, R, numpy, or similar, and an understanding of vectors, matrices, and relevant linear algebra concepts\n",
    "- An understanding of model selection, train/test split, performance metrics and other concepts covered in the session on Classical Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals for this session:\n",
    "- Examine deep learning concepts such as tensors, tensor operations, gradient descent, and backpropagation\n",
    "- Define and discuss hyperparameters in the context of deep learning models, including learning rate, batch size, epochs, layers, hidden units, optimizers, and activation functions\n",
    "- Interpret loss and accuracy curves to identify overfitting during the training process\n",
    "- Apply this knowledge to a real-world dataset using Tensorflow"
